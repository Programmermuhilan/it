            <p>Symposiam often feature a blend of technical and non-technical events, creating a dynamic environment for knowledge sharing and collaboration.

Non-technical events, on the other hand, may include networking sessions, team-building activities, and social events designed to promote engagement and knowledge exchange among a diverse group of attendees. This combination of technical and non-technical events ensures a well-rounded experience for all participants.</p>
